lfm.pl TODO
===========
This file contains ideas for future and bugs.

FEATURES
--------
* save output ($response->decoded_content in Last::get_xml_api20) locally.
* fetch the whole library (without getting banned).
* charts
* option -c for cache: do not fetch info for -t and -p from the net. 
* tracks - add support for -to, -from and -page
* get-sk - automate the process in this script
* export a HTTP server / interface (maybe for fun).
* write tests
    validity of parsed arguments
    argument mutual exclusions
    every command on good input
       same with -t / --t , -p / --p
       same with -s a/b/c and -r
    every command on bad input (from server)
    every command on void input or timeout (from server)
    every command without network

USABILITY
-------
* die fast on mutually exclusive arguments

BUGS
----
* lfm t -s title sorts on artist
* lfm p -s tracks does not sort on list length
* add -l support for -t to work (wot?)
* tracks -l 1 shows two entries
* [fixed] add --p ' this / that ' fails because of the / 

API LIMITATIONS
---------------
* Tracks upper limit 200 (page + timestamp from-to circumvents this?).
* [fixed] remove only one tag at a time
